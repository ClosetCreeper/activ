  <section class="privacy">
    <h2>Privacy First</h2>
    <p>
      We respect your privacy. All activity and app usage data remains on your device.
      The app uses Apple Health and Screen Time APIs solely to enforce your personal app usage limits based on your movement goals.
      We do not collect or share any personal or behavioral data.

  <section class="entitlement">
    <h2>Why We Use Screen Time Entitlement</h2>
    <p>
      This app requires the <code>com.apple.developer.screen-time</code> entitlement in order to manage and restrict third-party app access.
      This is a core part of the app‚Äôs functionality: we block access to selected apps until users complete their physical activity goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The feature aims to promote healthier screen habits and encourage physical activity ‚Äî especially in students, children, and screen-heavy users.
